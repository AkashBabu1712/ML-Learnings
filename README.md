# Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning projects and code examples that use Python, scikit-learn, and other popular machine learning libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use these projects, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

In addition, you need to install the following Python packages:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning.git
```

## Usage

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a Jupyter Notebook file and any necessary data files. To use a project, navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file:

```sh
cd project-directory
jupyter notebook
```

The Jupyter Notebook file contains code and documentation that explains the machine learning process and any insights or conclusions that were discovered.
